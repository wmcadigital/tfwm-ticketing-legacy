What is the logic for the quick buy button?
---
Currently it is set up so that it prioritises in this order...
Buy on Swift > Buy on Direct Debit > Quick buy > Buy at travel centre



What happens when you select two modes at the same time?
---
i.e. if you click bus and train?



Can't sort by price due to format
---
Some prices contain words whereas others contain absolute values
i.e. £5.40 vs Cash £5.40 - Swift PAYG £5.20
