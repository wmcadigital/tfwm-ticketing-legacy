## Release notes

---

For the latest updates, check out the [release notes](./RELEASE.md).

## Quick start

---

Clone the repo down to your directory and run `npm run fresh`, this will install all package dependencies and then launch a local webserver.

## Getting started

---

### Working directory

-   When working on the project, only edit files within the `/src/` directory.
-   All untouchable files will be sent to the `/build/` directory.

### Launching local webserver

If you have already installed all package dependencies then just run `npm run` to launch local webserver.

Whilst the webserver is active, it will watch the files in the 'src' directory for any changes and it will automatically compile the files and move them to the build directory on change. After doing so the browser window will automatically refresh or pull in the new CSS.
